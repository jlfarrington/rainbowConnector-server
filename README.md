# rainbowConnector-server

Rainbow Connector is a full-stack CRUD application deployed on Heroku. This application is the final Red Badge project for my Web Development course through Eleven Fifty Academy, which showcases the culmination of skills I have developed over the past six months of taking this part-time course.

## What is Rainbow Connector?
Rainbow Conncetor allows the average rainbow lover (who doesn't love rainbows?!) to log in and see any rainbows that have been reported near their geographic location. Did you see a rainbow? Snap a picture, log in to Rainbow Connector, and report your rainbow on the map! Users can view rainbows in either the map view or the feed view. Users can "heart" or "like" their favorite rainbows, and leave a comment to show their enthusiasm and share their love for rainbows. Rainbow Connector also supports administrator roles, where an admin user can moderate the Rainbow content, promote users, or delete rainbows and comments.
